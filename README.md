# ti.jsPDF

### Create PDF files using jsPDF (https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF/)

#### Tested with:
* jsPDF 3.0.1
* Titanium SDK 12.7.0.GA

#### Notes:

If you want to update jsPDF you can check https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF/ for updates and use the `jspdf.node.min.js` file and copy it into the `app/lib` folder.

Check [utf8_example.md](utf8_example.md) for an example how to include a custom font in order to use UTF8 characters. jsPDF can't do that by default.
